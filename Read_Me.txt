How to run the program.

Extract the doc.rar file to see the javadocs of the classes.
This program is designed to be tested and run on the console. What the user has to do is:

    1. Run the jar file submitted
        locate to the Scheduler.jar folder and type in java -jar ./Scheduler7.jar (runs 7 processes)
        and Scheduler2.jar (runs 2 processes)

    2. Open the project in an IDE like Eclipse or Netbeans and run it.

Once the program runs, it presents 8 choices, choose any one of them and observe the scheduling process unfold.

What to expect:
    - When the scheduling process starts you will see a 'List added' line which means the ready queue is produced
    - Then "Process 1 running' line will be seen, which is self explanatory
    - Then you will see 'Device thread called >>>>>>>>>' line appears, when the current process gets into 
    the Device queue
    - Then you will see two lines printed at the same time: 'Process 2 running' and 'Process 1 IO device #' will be 
    seen. The two lines are printed simultaneously because they are running concurrently.

How to modify the process numbers: (Default is set to 7 processes)
    If you want to increase and decrease the number of processes generated by the ProcessGen thread follow
    these steps: 
        - Open the ProcessGen class,
        - Locate the multiProcessEnqueue() method
        - There you will see an if statement like 
                if(numOfProcAdded == 3){
                    ProcessGen.pay.shutdown();
                    ...
        - Change the number to your own liking
